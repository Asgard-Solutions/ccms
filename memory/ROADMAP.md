# CCMS Roadmap

Prioritized backlog for remaining P0/P1/P2 work. Most-recent updates on top.

## Post-Freeze Maintenance (blocked on freeze lift)

- **[BLOCKED] Remove performance-governance compatibility re-exports** —
  see `/app/memory/TICKET_REMOVE_PERF_EXPORTS.md`.
  Behavior-preserving cleanup that removes the compatibility layer
  introduced when `scripts/_perf_gov_lib.py` was extracted. All shared
  governance primitives must be imported directly from `_perf_gov_lib`;
  no remaining shared-helper imports from `scripts.run_clinical_perf`;
  CLI behavior, output formats, exception semantics, and exit codes
  unchanged; full governance + clinical contract suites remain green;
  no Clinical UI / preferences / telemetry / feature-flag / frozen-
  contract code is modified; rollback is a single-commit revert.
  **Blocked until the redesign freeze is formally lifted.** Not logged
  in `CHANGELOG.md` yet — this is planned maintenance, not a shipped
  change.

## 2026-02-15 — Clinical redesign Phase 3 — **FROZEN**

**Status:** All slices shipped and frozen. Change-control now applies — see `/app/memory/CLINICAL_REDESIGN_FREEZE.md`. Remaining work is release-gate execution (G1–G6), not further development.

**Nested feature flag:** `clinicalRedesignPhase3` (child of `clinicalRedesign`).

| Slice | Status | Scope |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 — Cross-record linking & Deterministic Next Actions | ✅ Done | `useClinicalReturnState` hook, `nextActionsEngine`, `NextActionsPanel`, telemetry union, 50 backend + 25 frontend tests. |
| 2 — Advanced timeline filters, saved presets, long-timeline perf | ✅ Done | `TimelineFilterBar`, `SavedPresetsMenu`, sanitizer, backward-compat `schema_version 1.1`, durable `/me/preferences.clinical_ui_defaults`, 19 backend + 21 frontend tests. |
| 3 — Outcome snapshot, trend, optional suggestions | ✅ Done | `OutcomesSection`, `outcomeSeriesHelpers`, snapshot + trend + accessible table + milestone markers + deterministic suggestions. Independent flag `clinicalRedesignPhase3Slice3`. 25 frontend + 15 backend tests. |
| 2.1 — Preset icon-strip polish | ✅ Done | `PresetIconStrip` shows one icon per configured dimension with counts (never raw values), reuses sanitizer + stale detector, 10 tests. |
| 4 — Imaging metadata + filters, Data-quality indicators | ✅ Done (re-integrated 2026-02-15) | `ImagingCard` + `DataQualityPanel` re-wired above legacy `MediaCard` fallback. Independent flag `clinicalRedesignPhase3Slice4`. 17 frontend tests. |
| 5 — Role-aware views + configurable summary + durable prefs | ✅ Done (shipped 2026-02-15) | `workspaceModes.js` registry, `WorkspaceModeSwitcher`, `SummaryConfigDrawer` (Move up / Move down, no DnD). Extended `ClinicalUIDefaults` with `default_workspace_mode`, `summary_module_order`, `default_encounter_filter`, `default_outcome_view`, `collapsed_modules`. 24 frontend + 45 backend tests. Independent flag `clinicalRedesignPhase3Slice5`. |
| 6 — Telemetry, partial-failure handling, a11y hardening, UAT, rollback verification | ✅ Done (shipped 2026-02-15) | `SectionErrorBoundary` wraps Imaging/Outcomes/Timeline; `test_telemetry_phi_probe.py` (25 fields); WorkspaceModeSwitcher aria-live + persistent description; 5-level surface tokens (light + dark); `ClinicalTabV2.flagMatrix.test.js`; `/app/memory/PHASE3_UAT.md` (50 scenarios). Independent flag `clinicalRedesignPhase3Slice6`. |

### Release gates (G1–G6) — pending

- [ ] **G1** — 50-scenario UAT sign-off (`PHASE3_UAT.md`). Owner: Clinical operations.
- [ ] **G2** — P50/P95 perf measurement on ≥ 200-event timeline chart. Owner: Platform reliability.
- [ ] **G3** — Production rollback procedure walk-through. Owner: Clinical platform lead + Platform reliability.
- [ ] **G4** — Contract freeze on `ClinicalUIDefaults` / `UIEventPayload` / featureFlags / workspaceModes. Owner: Clinical platform lead.
- [ ] **G5** — Screenshots per workspace mode + release notes. Owner: Clinical platform lead.
- [ ] **G6** — Staged rollout (internal → pilot clinic → GA). Owner: Release manager.

### Deferred / Blocked (do NOT re-scope during freeze)

- Diagnosis "Set inactive" state — awaiting backend status-model decision. Do not map to "resolved".
- Reuse of `SectionErrorBoundary` around AI Scribe / Billing Ledger — needs separately scoped resilience review (idempotency, unsaved-state preservation, PHI safety in richer surfaces).
- Case-type-based outcome suggestion mappings.
- Chart-at-a-glance print sheet, My Worklist, Today's Chart Preview, Billing digest, Clinic-wide DQ dashboard, Change Healthcare / Optum transport, AI cost estimator, Admin-facing feature-flag panel, first-open workspace-mode toast.
- Application-wide theme overhaul.
- Seed a demo patient with `total_visits_planned > completed + scheduled` **or** stale `configured_outcome_measures` so browser regressions can exercise the dismissible Next-Action flows end-to-end.


## 2026-04-22 — Billing / Claims / Change-Optum accepted status

**Status: PARTIAL — sandbox-ready, not production-complete; blocked
only on live Change/Optum production transport and related business
prerequisites.**

- Phases 1–5, 7–12: accepted (PASS).
- Phase 6 (Change/Optum submission pipeline): accepted as PARTIAL /
  sandbox-ready only. 837P generator, scrubber pre-submit gate, bulk
  submit, and trace/correlation persistence are green in sandbox.
  Live HTTPS transmission to production is not active.
- Next milestone (single remaining blocker): complete live
  Change/Optum production transport once credentials, enrollment,
  and related business prerequisites are available. Estimated ~50
  LoC inside `clearinghouse/change_healthcare.py::submit()`.


## 2026-02-15

### Access Management redesign (5-phase plan)
| Phase | Status | Scope |
|-------|--------|-------|
| 1 — Permission catalog (backend) | ✅ Done | 11 modules, 117 decorated perms, 3 endpoints, 12/12 tests |
| 2 — Custom roles CRUD (backend)  | ✅ Done | create / clone / patch / archive + session epoch bump, 14/14 tests |
| 3 — Users screen + Create flow (frontend) | ✅ Done | `/admin/users`, 3-step dialog, Edit Access dialog, nav wired |
| 4 — Roles screen + Role Editor (frontend) | ✅ Done | `/admin/roles` card grid, grouped accordion editor, clone/archive flows |
| 5 — Migration + Access History + Security Policies | ✅ Done | legacy backfill, `/admin/access-history`, Security Policies panel |

### Recently completed P2 items
- ✅ Patient portal shell at `/portal` with role gating (patients
  redirected in; non-patients locked out) — 2026-04-22.
- ✅ Month-end bulk "Send outstanding statements" workflow —
  `POST /api/billing/statements/send-outstanding` + Billing Dashboard
  button with dry-run preview dialog; idempotent on unchanged
  balances — 2026-04-22.
- ✅ Global retry-after-reauth Axios interceptor (already shipped in an earlier session; confirmed wired).
- ✅ Drag-and-drop reorder for Appointment Types — backend `POST /api/appointment-types/reorder` + native HTML5 DnD UI, zero deps.
- ✅ Resend + Twilio integration layer — `services/notifications/{email,sms,verify}.py` with log-only fallback; password-reset + workforce-invitation callers wired; `.env.example` documents all required env vars.

### Phase 5 sub-tasks (P0 to unblock full rollout)
- Dry-run migration script: map legacy `user.role` strings → baseline
  role keys via `LEGACY_ROLE_TO_KEY`. Log ambiguous mappings; emit
  summary (`count_mapped`, `count_ambiguous`, `count_unmapped`).
- Idempotent backfill runner in `services/authz/seed.py` (extend existing
  back-fill block so it also writes `is_custom=False` on legacy roles +
  stamps `legacy_mapped_at` on user_roles rows).
- New `/admin/access-history` page surfacing `GET /api/audit-logs`
  filtered on action prefix `authz.role.*` / `authz.override.*` /
  `authz.elevation.*`. Sortable table; CSV export reuses existing
  `/api/audit-logs/export.csv`.
- Deprecation banner on existing `/roles`, `/permissions`, and
  `/access-review` pages pointing to `/admin/users` + `/admin/roles`.
- (Optional) Rename internal `custom_{slug}_{hex}` role keys scheme
  to `tenant-prefixed` for clarity when multi-tenant grows.

### Open action items
- Resolve CreateUserDialog double-PIN-step-up friction by deferring
  `/authz/roles` fetch until step 2 — **done** in Phase 3 polish.
- Audit stray custom roles from test runs (`Test Role *`,
  `Patch Test *`, `InUse Test *`, `Delete Test *`) — cleanup currently
  manual via `DELETE /api/authz/roles/{key}?force=true`. Consider a
  scheduled purge or `prefix=test_` + TTL policy.
